        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
<ul>
  <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
      </ul>

      <header>What you should already know</header><p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:

A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world"><header>Hello world</header><p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
<code>
function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");</code>
Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
With the keyword var. For example,
<code>var x = 42.</code>
This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

By simply assigning it a value. For example,<code>x=42.</code></p></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header><p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.

<code>const PI = 3.14;</code></p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
<code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code></p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
<code>while (condition) statement</code></p>

      <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p></section>
